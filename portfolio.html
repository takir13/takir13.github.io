                            In Lab 1, "Introduction to Mobile App Development," I delved into the significance of mobile security, exploring its history, definition, uses, advantages, disadvantages, and future trends. I learned that mobile security, crucial for protecting personal and corporate information on smartphones, has evolved significantly since the introduction of the first portable mobile phone in 1973. Key takeaways included the importance of securing connections, texts, images, and financial information, as well as understanding the challenges and costs associated with implementing robust security measures. Future trends in mobile security, such as biometric technologies and 5G network challenges, were also highlighted. My personal experience with a phishing attempt reinforced the importance of vigilance and strong security practices.

                            In Lab 2, "XML and Related Technologies," I gained an in-depth understanding of how XML is structured and used to store and transport data. I explored the creation and validation of XML documents using Document Type Definitions (DTD), learning to define elements and attributes to ensure data consistency and integrity. By working with XML, DTD code, and validation processes, I developed a solid grasp of how XML plays a crucial role in data representation, particularly in mobile app development. This lab highlighted the importance of adhering to standards and best practices to facilitate accurate data exchange and integration across different systems.

                            In Lab 3, "Android Studio: App Development," I developed an energy science quiz app with Android Studio. I faced several challenges, including navigating the IDE and managing XML layouts and constraints. Integrating the text-to-speech feature was particularly complex. Testing on BlueStacks X had performance issues, so I tested on a physical device. Overall, this experience enhanced my understanding of Android development and coding skills, making me eager to learn more about advanced topics in the future.

                            In Lab 4, "Android Studio: App Development - Classes," I explored the concept of classes in Dart. I learned how to define classes and their properties, implement constructors, and utilize inheritance and method overriding. Through practical examples, I understood how classes model real-world objects, promote code reuse, and enhance modularity. The lab also highlighted the differences between Dart's classes and those in other programming languages, emphasizing the advantages of using classes for structured and maintainable code in mobile app development.

                            In Lab 5, "Flutter Introduction - Material Components," I learned how to use Material Components in Flutter to create a user-friendly and visually appealing task management application. I implemented various Material Buttons (ElevatedButton, OutlinedButton, and TextButton) and Material Cards to display task information effectively. Each card includes task details and interactive elements such as checkboxes and remove buttons, following material design principles to ensure a consistent and cohesive user experience. Through this exercise, I enhanced my understanding of Flutter's design components and their application in real-world scenarios, improving my skills in mobile app development.

                            In classwork 1, "Android Studio: App Development," working on the Android app project was both challenging and enjoyable. Setting up Android Studio and an external emulator gave a strong basis for Android development environments. Designing the layout to show personalized information like my name, Banner ID, class, section, and favourite quote gave me a chance to play with different UI elements and constraints. Testing the app on both the Android Studio emulator and an external emulator such as Bluestacks showed the importance of cross-platform compatibility. One of the most challenging tasks was ensuring that the layout showed consistency across different kinds of screens and resolutions. Overall, this project helped me understand Android development and gave practical knowledge of fixing and improving app performance.

                            In classwork 2, "MIT App Inventor: App Development," I faced several challenges and learned many things while creating my app on Healthy Meal Planner. At first, I struggled to navigate between screens. It took careful focus on how buttons and logic blocks were connected. After that, it took several drafts to ensure users could enter meal details, view details, and clear details. I was able to understand how to use logical blocks effectively to manage user inputs and outputs. Maintaining a consistent design idea across two screens was challenging, but I learned how to properly add colours and fonts. I got skilled in using several input types, which helped me understand user interactions in apps. The classwork gave me practical experience with logic blocks, helping me know how to build active functionality according to user input. Overall, it caught my interest in food and health, motivating me to keep learning the connection between technology and health.

                            In classwork 3, "Flutter: App Development," moving from Android Studio to Flutter was both hard and fun. Using XML for layout design in Android Studio might be useful, but it can also be tedious and complicated for advanced interfaces. The challenges I faced were changing to the Dart programming language and Flutter's widget architecture and learning the widget tree structure. The advantages are that Flutter helps cross-platform development, hot reloading for fast changes, and a big collection of already built widgets, and Android Studio gives full design tools, improved interaction with specific Android tools, and strong debugging features. The disadvantages are that Flutter needs understanding new structures and language, and Android Studio's user interface build step is more complicated and takes time. While Android Studio's extensive tools make it suitable for making specific Android applications, Flutter's multi-platform support and fast creation step make it an outstanding option for programmers who want to rapidly make apps for many platforms.
